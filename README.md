# EDPirateMissionTracker

## [Installer Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylewill0725/EDPirateMissionTracker/master/publish/setup.exe)

## What does this do?
This program shows you the distribution of massacre missions, statistics on the massacre missions,
and (while turning in) where in your transaction tab those missions are.  
No manual input is needed.  
  
## How does it work?
It scans your game logs the same way programs like EDDiscovery do. By tracking mission accepts, redirects, completes,
and bounty events, it keeps an updated list of active missions and their approximate kill count.  

## Other questions?
Feel free to create an issue for any questions or suggestions and I'll answer as soon I can.
